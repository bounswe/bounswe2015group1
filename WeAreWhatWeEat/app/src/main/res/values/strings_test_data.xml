    <string name="test_comment_recipe1">This is by far the best recipe I\'ve ever made and it turned out perfect!</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe2">A++ Decadently Delicious! I\'ve tried many recipes from this site, all of them pleasing.
        But this is the first time I\'ve ever been so inspired by one to write a review!</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe3">Believe the hype. I made this for the first time for a dinner party I had last week -
        mostly because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And it did not disappoint. Some people were begging for the recipe.
        The others were saying it was the best thing they had ever tasted. There were riots over who was going to get the last piece.
        Truly spectacular.</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe4">I followed this recipe as it\'s written, and it came out awful for me.
        And unfortunately it was for my first thanksgiving dinner. My guests pretended to like it but I saw the
        disgust in their faces. I hate my life.</string>

        Beat well with a fork.\n\nPut a small frying pan on a low heat and let it get hot.
        Add a small knob of butter. When the butter has melted and is bubbling,
        add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly.
        When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top,
        sprinkle over the cheese, if using (I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette).
        \n\nUsing a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half.
        When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate."
