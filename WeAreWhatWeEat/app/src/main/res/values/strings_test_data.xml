    <string name="test_comment_recipe1">This is by far the best recipe I\'ve ever made and it turned out perfect!</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe2">A++ Decadently Delicious! I\'ve tried many recipes from this site, all of them pleasing.
        But this is the first time I\'ve ever been so inspired by one to write a review!</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe3">Believe the hype. I made this for the first time for a dinner party I had last week -
        mostly because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And it did not disappoint. Some people were begging for the recipe.
        The others were saying it was the best thing they had ever tasted. There were riots over who was going to get the last piece.
        Truly spectacular.</string>
    <string name="test_comment_recipe4">I followed this recipe as it\'s written, and it came out awful for me.
        And unfortunately it was for my first thanksgiving dinner. My guests pretended to like it but I saw the
        disgust in their faces. I hate my life.</string>

        Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil.
        Reduce temperature and let simmer.
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice
        work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it
        does not run off.
        Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft."
